        <section class="reason black-section">
            <img src="Horse.png" alt="Horse" class="Logoparts">
            <p>Starting with the Horse it was chosen obviously because of the name of they team Mavericks as a symbol towards the animal.</p>

        <section class="reason dark_blue-section">
            <img src="cross.png" alt="Horse" class="Logoparts float-right">
            <p>Secondly, the crosses represnt the fact it's under a catholic school, using the representation for christianity and the text is just the name of the Team.</p>

        <section class="reason blue-section">
            <img src="hoove.png" alt="Horse" class="Logoparts">
            <p>The Hoove represents the Horse and gives more detail to the logo to prevent it from feeling plain and basic.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="reason black-section">
            <p>Extra Details wanted to add pictures of School athlete team but the instagram is privated :(, I created twitter posts to compensate for the lack of content on the website also everything made by scratch wanted to practice web development was a fun project.</p>
